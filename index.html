                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When zoomedi n with awp your accuracy is good but unzooming and changing targets feels uncomfortable</li>
                    <li>Spraying at medium to long distances with rifles is very uncomfortable especially AK</li>
                    <li>Somtimes when you start shooting your crosshair is not on the enemies head which leads to a high amount of body shot kills</li>
                    <li>Sometimes you start shooting before your crosshair is on the enemy forcing you to correct the distance when spraying which is harder.</li>
                    <li>Your average crosshair placement when moving around is towards the chest/wasit instead of the head which requires you to flick upwards when going for headshots which increases your TTK</li>
                    <li>Sometimes your Counter-Strafing doesn't sync properly and you accidentally start shooting while you haven't stopped</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Armour, nice calm tapping on the first guy and good job waiting for the teammates flash, good job holding the flank and not getting greedy for kills overall a solid round. W</li>
                    <li>P90 armour, interesting choice not to buy headarmour as a single usp headshot can kill you, when going agro into brackets crosshair placement wasn’t great incase there was an enemy facing, fortunately there was no action and you managed to plant the bomb and play safely. W</li>
                    <li>P90 armour, Good push up banana and nice job not getting caught up in the gunfight top banana instead focusing on the possible flank which you countered perfectly and nice job looking for the second enemy although after taking such significant damage from the first I would have recommended repositioning to allow you to surprise the second enemy more. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, when moving up second middle early in the round expect aggression from Apps and play accordingly which means having your weapon out and being ready to dodge a flash, although fortunately, you didn’t have to fight, good rotation back to B and good job holding Mexico to get the kill on the last player attempting a flank, overall really good round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice aggression top banana but you didn’t use your utility when taking map control, unfortunate first duel you missed your spray a bit but don’t worry about that. W</li>
                    <li>Krieg buy, again going up second middle with a knife out which is dangerous, interesting choice in weaponry over AK because of the reduced fire rate and damage but you got lucky when you spotted the enemy as you pulled out your utility but you were able to pull it back and get the kill. W</li>
                    <li>M4 buy, I don’t know why you chose m4 over AK whenever possible I would recommend picking up the better gun as this could help you win gun fights without even thinking about it, when throwing utility only do it when there is no chance of you getting peeked by the enemy this is the second time this match you have almost and have died with utility out, you will always do more damage and have more impact with a gun. W</li>
                    <li>Krieg buy, Good job clearing apps I like the methodical approach to clearing angle, unfortunately, once the enemies position was exposed you didn’t immediately take advantage of it which allowed them to fall back to a comfortable position where they had the advantage, also scoping in with the kreig significantly reduces your movement which didn’t allow you to reposition. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice kill top banana, unfortunately, this round was a bit dangerous as you decided not to continue with your teammates onto site when you already had someone watching the flank which made the fight on site a lot harder, fortunately, it got sorted and you were able to kill the flank which was good but make sure there is always enough man-power to take the site because there is no point holding the flank if you can’t take the site and win the round. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Really nice double kill entry top banana, giving your team free reign over banana, unfortunately, they did end up trading you but you did a good job, not much utility is being used during these rounds and most of it is going to waste. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good attempt at going for the trade on your teammate although you did manage to secure the kill you, unfortunately, took a lot more damage than was necessary which led to you dying in the second engagement on the player arches, sometimes its better if you know you are low HP to instead stay alive and have your presence as a pressure on the enemies because although on low HP your combat ability is low and potential of you being alive is huge. W</li>
                    <li>Krieg buy,  Nice silent movement allowing you to completely catch the enemy pushing middle off allowing you to get a free kill, but unfortunately, you lost the bomb (it was in the corner by Mexico) but this led to you jumping and moving around with your knife out which the enemies pushing banana were swiftly able to deal with you once you peeked without a weapon. L</li>
                    <li>Tec9 armour, nice push-up middle unfortunately your position in the corner wasn’t great for a pistol as the distance was slightly outside the optimal range try always choosing spots that greatly benefit your current weapon. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at getting an entry on A site unfortunately your crosshair placement was off which led to you taking a lot of damage good use of sound to make the enemy on sight think you fell off but then moved into a good position to catch him off guard, unfortunate 1v1 but good attempt and nice rationalization with the low time but he managed to hit a good shot. L</li>
                    <li>P90 buy, Fantastic play over towards B killing 2 top banana and continuing to make sound and distract causing 1 of the 2 last players to rotate while your 4 other teammates take A site, and to end the round with a nice triple kill, overall well played. W</li>
                    <li>CT pistol amour, solid position arch to attempt to catch the enemies pushing up middle although your movement let you down because as you were moving the peeked and you couldn’t counter-strafe quickly enough to do significant damage, unfortunately, you did take significant damage in this first engagement which led to your next fight being very difficult to win. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, although you retreating could be seen as baiting by your teammates I understand the thought process behind it and it worked perfectly allowing you to catch a planting player leaving you in a 1v1 although I noticed your shooting and movement seemed panicked and overly exaggerated which led to quite a few missed shots. L</li>
                    <li>P90 buy, nice p90 swing getting a double kill, although jumping through the molly with your knife out was dangerous I understand why you did it although when you have to cross a gap as significant as falling back from cubby to long its usually very easy for the enemies to kill you on that cross, after that you killed the enemy pushing up lane and then got a solid spray down on the other enemy pushing up long, overall good quad kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice kill on the enemy brackets but a small mistake missing the spray on the enemy with the tec9 pushing arch although they did hit a pretty good shot. W</li>
                    <li>P90 buy, When you are thinking about throwing utility hold the angle until the second you decide to drop some utility and then try to do it as quickly as possible this prevents most chances of you getting peeked with utility out, solid spray kill on the guy coming out of boiler and good backup to kill the enemy lane from arch who was focused on your teammate pit. W</li>
                    <li>P90 buy, You nearly died again with utility out although fortunately, you managed to kill him while blind with your own flash, and a solid double kill after that with the p90. W</li>
                    <li>P90 buy, nice use of utility this round but no action. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you during that game, did you get the poistions you wanted? <br> In-game kind of had the positions I wanted and usually pushed banana without a molly but during this game the molly was dropped every round which was a bit of an inconvienience, and CT side I was pretty comfortable in any position, but teammates started communicating in Russian which was a bit of an inconvienience.</li>
